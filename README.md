# Kia Ora! I'm Pathik ðŸ‘‹
I'm a self-driven technology enthusiast with an appetite for solving business challenges. 

My experience from a fast-paced administrative role at a large organisation and performance-driven e-commerce role at an SME have taught me to take ownership of my work and overcome business challenges while being resourceful, curious and driven. 

After years of interest in tech and self-learning over the year, I decided to take a plunge into programming and have been hooked ever since. I am excited to bring my fresh perspectives and problem-solving skills to make a meaningful contribution to a dynamic team.
